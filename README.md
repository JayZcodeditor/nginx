# Nginx - High-Performance Web Server and Reverse Proxy

Nginx (pronounced as "Engine-X") is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It is widely used for serving static content, load balancing, and handling high-traffic websites due to its efficiency and speed.

---

## üìå **Overview**
Nginx is an HTTP and reverse proxy server designed for high-performance and scalability. It is known for its ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it a popular choice for modern web applications and services.

**Features:**
- Reverse Proxy
- Load Balancing (Round-robin, Least Connections, IP Hash)
- SSL Termination
- HTTP/2 Support
- Static File Serving
- WebSocket Support
- Rate Limiting and Security Headers
- Caching and Compression
- Highly Configurable

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**

### 1. **Install Nginx on Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### 2. **Start Nginx Service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### 3. **Enable Nginx to Start on Boot:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### 4. **Check Nginx Status:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Basic Configuration**

### 1. **Nginx Configuration File:**
The main configuration file for Nginx is located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. You can modify it to configure global settings, HTTP settings, logging, and more.

Example:
```nginx
http {
    include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
}
```

### 2. **Server Block Configuration:**
To set up a new website, create a new server block in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and link it to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.

Example for a basic website configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

## üîÑ **Reverse Proxy Configuration**

### Example of a basic reverse proxy setup:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Load Balancing with Nginx**

Nginx allows you to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.

### Example:
```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
}
```

You can use various load-balancing strategies like **round-robin**, **least_conn**, or **ip_hash**.

## üîê **SSL Configuration**

### 1. **Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate (For testing purposes):**
```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt -days 365
```

### 2. **Configure SSL in Nginx:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

---

## üìà **Monitoring and Logs**

Nginx keeps logs for every request. The access log and error log are usually located in `/var/log/nginx/`:

- **Access Log:** `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
- **Error Log:** `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

### Example of monitoring logs in real-time:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

## ‚ö° **Optimization Tips**

- **Enable Gzip Compression:**
```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript;
```

- **Increase Worker Processes and Connections for High Traffic:**
```nginx
worker_processes auto;
worker_connections 2048;
```

- **Configure Caching for Static Content:**
```nginx
location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js|pdf)$ {
    expires 30d;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, no-transform";
}
```
